# Scuttled Architecture Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the refactoring of Scuttled from a trait-object-based architecture (Arc<dyn Trait>) to a concrete-type architecture (Copy/Clone types) with enhanced event-driven communication.

**Current State:** Well-architected async IMAP server with trait-based abstractions and channel-driven state management.

**Target State:** Event-driven architecture with Copy/Clone shared components, eliminating Arc/RwLock overhead and improving performance.

---

## Architecture Comparison: Current vs. Proposed

| Component | Current | Proposed | Gap Analysis |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Storage** | MailStore trait + FilesystemMailStore | Storage: path/key lookup, flag updates via rename/metadata | Need flag update support, rename from MailStore |
| **StorageWatcher** | FilesystemWatcher (coupled to Index) | StorageWatcher: emit events on write/update/delete | Decouple from Index, make purely event-driven |
| **Indexer** | Index trait + Indexer impl | Full text search, reconstructible from Storage | Ensure full reconstruction capability |
| **Searcher** | ❌ Does not exist | Read-only Indexer | **NEW: Create read-only search interface** |
| **Mailboxes** | Mailboxes trait + InMemoryMailboxes | Registry of mailboxes | Exists, convert to Copy/Clone |
| **Mailbox** | Mailbox struct in types.rs | Shared state (UID→path, validity, subscriptions) | **NEW: Make Copy/Clone shared component** |
| **Events** | EventBus with pub-sub | Core event bus with sync/async subscriptions | Add oneshot channel support for sync mutations |
| **CommandHandlers** | CommandHandler trait only | CommandHandlers registry + CommandHandler | **NEW: Create registry/dispatcher** |
| **Session** | Session struct with direct dispatch | Hands off TcpStream to handlers | Refactor for clean handler handoff |
| **Connection** | Connection enum (Plain/TLS) | Plain or TLS TCP stream | ✅ Already exists |
| **Server** | ImapServer struct | Starts loops, listeners, signals | Enhance signal handling |
| **UserStore** | UserStore trait + SQLiteUserStore | Add ACLs, shared mailbox permissions | Add ACL/permissions support |
| **Queue** | Queue trait + ChannelQueue | Async work queue | ✅ Already exists |
| **Authenticator** | Authenticator trait + BasicAuthenticator | Handles authentication | ✅ Already exists |

### 1.2 Copy/Clone Architecture for Shared Components (3-4 days) 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Replace Arc<dyn Trait> with Copy/Clone concrete types for Storage, Searcher, and Mailbox.

**Progress:** Storage and Searcher foundation complete. Remaining: Mailbox handle + Server migration.

#### 1.2.1 Storage Redesign

**Current Pattern:**
```rust
Arc<dyn MailStore> // Cloning increments refcount
```

**Target Pattern:**
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Storage {
    tx: Sender<StorageCommand>, // Cheap to clone
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create new Storage module (kept mailstore for backward compat)
- [x] Implement flag updates via filesystem rename (Maildir cur/new convention)
- [x] Make Storage struct Clone (wraps channel sender)
- [x] Add all core methods: store, retrieve, delete, exists, update_flags
- [x] Create StoreMail trait for file operations abstraction
- [x] Create FilesystemStore implementation with channel-based writes
- [x] Make Storage generic over StoreMail + MailboxFormat
- [ ] Add streaming read support (return AsyncRead instead of Vec<u8>)
- [ ] Update all references from Arc<dyn MailStore> to Storage

**Files:**
- `src/storage.rs` ✅ Generic over StoreMail + MailboxFormat
- `src/storage/store_mail.rs` ✅ Low-level file operations trait
- `src/storage/filesystem_store.rs` ✅ Channel-based implementation
- `src/mailstore/` - Kept for backward compatibility
- `src/server.rs` - Update to use concrete Storage type (pending)
- `src/session.rs` - Update references (pending)

**Completion Notes:**
- Storage is now generic: `Storage<S: StoreMail, F: MailboxFormat>`
- StoreMail trait: write, move_file, remove, write_metadata, read, exists
- FilesystemStore: Clone-able with channel-based writer loop
- Clear separation: StoreMail (file I/O) vs MailboxFormat (filename conventions)
- All 5 storage tests passing including flag updates
- Maildir flag format fully implemented (D/F/R/S/T flags)
- Atomic file operations with fsync
- Commits: 53d8d49, 964053c

- [ ] Make Mailbox wrapping a sender channel (cheap clone)

**Files:**
- `src/mailbox.rs` (new file) - Shared Mailbox handle
- `src/types.rs` - Keep MailboxMetadata struct for data

#### 1.2.3 Searcher Creation ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create read-only Searcher struct (completely separate from Indexer)

- [ ] Add search optimization for common queries (future)
- [ ] Create SearchBackend implementation that wraps IndexBackend (future)

**Files:**
- `src/searcher.rs` ✅ Complete read/write separation from Indexer

**Completion Notes:**
- **Full read/write separation achieved** - Searcher has NO dependency on Indexer
- SearchBackend trait provides read-only query interface
- Searcher wraps Arc<dyn SearchBackend> for cheap cloning
- Complete API: search(), list_mailboxes(), message_count(), mailbox_exists()
- MockSearchBackend for testing
- 3 tests passing
- Architecture enforces read-only access at compile time
- Commits: 53d8d49, 964053c

**Success Criteria:**

## Open Questions

1. Should Storage support multiple backends (S3, etc.) or just filesystem?
2. Do we need distributed UID coordination for multi-node deployments?
3. Should EventBus support persistent event log for crash recovery?
4. What's the migration path for existing deployments (data format changes)?
5. Should we implement IMAP IDLE extension during this refactor?
